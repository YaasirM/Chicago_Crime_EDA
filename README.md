<h1 align ="Center"> Chicago Crime EDA </h1>

## Overview
Chicago has faced a longstanding reputation for high crime rates. While crime levels have fluctuated over the years, certain community areas consistently report higher crime rates, often linked to economic disparities, unemployment, and systemic challenges.

The primary goal of this project is to assess and analyze Chicago's crime patterns and their potential correlation with socioeconomic conditions and school performance. By the end of this project, I hope we can discover the following:

- Identify crime hotspots and trends in different community areas.
- Examine the relationship between crime and socioeconomic factors, such as income levels and hardship index.
- Assess school safety and its connection to crime in the vicinity.

## Task
This project involves analyzing three key datasets from Chicago using SQL and Python to provide insights into crime, socioeconomic conditions, and school performance. The datasets are integrated into an SQLite database for efficient querying and include:

1. [Chicago Crime Data](https://github.com/YaasirM/Chicago_Crime_EDA/blob/main/assets/dataset/ChicagoCrimeData.csv): A record of reported incidents of crime in Chicago from 2001 to the present, with details about types of crimes, locations, and arrest information.
2. [Socioeconomic Indicators (Census Data)](https://github.com/YaasirM/Chicago_Crime_EDA/blob/main/assets/dataset/ChicagoCensusData.csv): Data showing socioeconomic factors like per capita income, poverty levels, and a hardship index for each Chicago community area.
3. [Chicago Public Schools Data](https://github.com/YaasirM/Chicago_Crime_EDA/blob/main/assets/dataset/ChicagoPublicSchools.csv): Performance metrics and safety scores for public schools during the 2011â€“2012 academic year.



First we load all the data sets into the notebook, as well as the desired python packages we will be utilising:

```python
import pandas as pd
import csv, sqlite3

con = sqlite3.connect("FinalDB.db")
cur = con.cursor()
%load_ext sql
Census_Data = pd.read_csv("https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DB0201EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/FinalModule_Coursera_V5/data/ChicagoCensusData.csv?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDB0201ENSkillsNetwork20127838-2021-01-01")
Chicago_PS = pd.read_csv("https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DB0201EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/FinalModule_Coursera_V5/data/ChicagoPublicSchools.csv?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDB0201ENSkillsNetwork20127838-2021-01-01")
Chicago_Crime = pd.read_csv("https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DB0201EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/FinalModule_Coursera_V5/data/ChicagoCrimeData.csv?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMDeveloperSkillsNetworkDB0201ENSkillsNetwork20127838-2021-01-01")
Census_Data.to_sql("CENSUS_DATA", con, if_exists='replace', index=False,method="multi")
Chicago_PS.to_sql("CHICAGO_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS", con, if_exists='replace', index=False,method="multi")
Chicago_Crime.to_sql("CHICAGO_CRIME_DATA", con, if_exists='replace', index=False,method="multi")
%sql sqlite:///FinalDB.db
```

## Conclusion
From the SQL analysis, we have discovered insights into crime, socio-economic conditions, and education in Chicago:

- Crime Patterns: A total of 533 crimes were recorded, with minors frequently involved. Schools were common crime locations, highlighting the need for better safety measures.
- Crime Hotspots: Austin had the highest crime rates, while Riverdale showed the greatest hardship index and poverty levels. Fuller Park and Englewood also faced severe hardship, correlating with higher crime rates.
- School Safety: Public schools showed varying safety scores, with elementary and high schools averaging higher safety ratings than middle schools, indicating a need for more consistent safety standards.
Using SQL subqueries, the analysis identified community areas with the highest crime and hardship levels, demonstrating the value of structured data analysis. These findings reveal the link between socio-economic challenges, crime, and education, guiding targeted policy efforts.

This project helped to develop my SQL skills further. Areas that improved the most included subqueries, aggregate functions, and joins to analyze crime statistics, socio-economic factors, and public school safety. Advanced skills were developed, including case statements for conditional analysis and window functions for ranking and partitioning data. Working with large datasets improved query optimization and the ability to write efficient, structured SQL scripts.

## Jupyter Notebook
The analysis and modelling were performed using Python, SQL and Jupyter Notebook. You can find the complete notebook [here](https://github.com/YaasirM/Chicago_Crime_EDA/blob/main/assets/Chicago_Crime_EDA_Notebook.ipynb)
